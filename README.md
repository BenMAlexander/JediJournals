# Jedi Journals
### About The Project
<p>The goal of this React project was to fetch character information from SWAPI (Star Wars API). For each character pulled a card is generated featuring their name and a randomly assigned photo from Picsum.photos. 
When a card is clicked, it expands to reveal more details about the character.</p>
